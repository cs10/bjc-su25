Hi! My name is Joanna and I'm a senior majoring in Data Science. I'm from Taiwan. I'm excited to be an AI for CS10 this semester. I'm researching game theory, statistics, and machine learning. Outside of the classroom, I love to cook, listen to music, and watch movies. Feel free to ask me anything ❕❗❕
