# Labs

Lab Slides and Worksheets: [Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z6518_Tq-_wgIOnwOTZUg6O8sBNtHJAc?usp=sharing)

> Labs are an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned in lecture in code (and other forms) All labs have a conceptual and a coding component. All labs assignments must be uploaded and autograded using Gradescope; the Gradescope link can be found on the worksheet. There is also two sets of practice exams that will count towards your lab grade (the Practice Midterm and the Practice Postterm). You will need to take both the coding and non-coding portions to receive credit. Credit for the practice exams is based on completion only not the score you received on the practice exam. 

> The worksheeks linked below are high-level overviews and can be seen as a set of instructions for  lab. Each worksheet lists all the required blocks, functions, or tasks for a particular lab. The worksheets also contain some of the test cases used to grade the lab.

> The workbook, which differs from the worksheet, is used as a step-by-step guide to complete each lab. Lab worksheets will be released at 5:00 PM on the lab day.
